Build Instructions for Mac OSX
==============================

How to build the binary OSX version of the XIG in five easy steps!


1. Install the *32-bit* version of Python from http://www.python.org
   
   The version of Python distributed with OSX apparantly does not
   work well with XIG and py2app.  Similarly, the 64-bit version of
   the official Python 2.7 also does not work well with XIG.

2. Install ez_setup if not already installed:

   $ curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
   $ sudo python ez_setup.py -U setuptools 

3. Install py2app from easy_install:

   $ sudo easy_install -U py2app

4. Run the build script from this directory (build-bin/osx/build.sh):

   $ ./build.sh

5. Once the build is complete two directories will be created, "build"
   and "dist".  "xig.app" will be found in the "dist" directory and
   is ready to distribute!

   N.B. if you create an official build, make certain to distribute a
   fresh build of xig.app!  If you have run the xig.app on your local
   machine its contents will have been modified as the configuration
   and state information are saved within the xig.app bundle.
